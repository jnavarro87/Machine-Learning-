# Machine-Learning

In this place you can find my latest codes in the area of Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Some Codes are from Kaggle Championships, some other are form University tasks


### Wines: "Fraud vs Legit" Wine Fraud Detection with SVC(Support Vector Classifier)
* This is a code based on SVM to try to find out if a wine its legit or fraud using the chemical features from the wine_fraud Dataset
The dataset is found on the Data Folder

### House Price Championship Kaggle with different regression plus random forest classifier(Data Clean, Feature Engineering + Different models of ML)
* This is a code for the Kaggle Championship knowledge, that considers data cleaning, feature engineering, and try different models till choose the better model to increas predictability accordig to kaggle metrics

### Machine Learning Final Work Magister Inteligencia Artificial
* Practical work on Machine Learning algorithms in Python
